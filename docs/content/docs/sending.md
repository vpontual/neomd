## Beautiful Markdown Composer with **Live-Preview** in Neovim

Since you compose every email in Neovim as a `neomd-*.md` buffer, a small markdown plugin setup makes the writing experience much nicer — headings get colored blocks, code fences get borders, bullets get spacing, and callouts (`> [!note]`) render with icons live as you type.

### Workflow of Writing and Composing an Email
1. **Pre-Composer**: Fill in your emails and subject:
![neomd in neovim with rendered markdown](/images/composing-1.png)

2. **Composer**: Write your email in Neovim with Markdown rendering enabled (see configs below):
![neomd in neovim with rendered markdown](/images/composing-2.png)

3. **Post-Composer and Pre-Sent View**: Preview, change FROM sender, attach files, etc.:
![neomd in neovim with rendered markdown](/images/composing-3.png)

4. **Preview in Browser**: Preview email in Browser - shows emails, Markdown rendered HTML.

### Optional Neovim Configuratios 
*Recommended for nice look and live rendering while you compose your emails*

The single plugin that does most of the work is [render-markdown.nvim](https://github.com/MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim). Drop this file into your lazy.nvim plugin folder (e.g. `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/markdown.lua`):

```lua
return {
  -- Live inline rendering: headings, code blocks, bullets, callouts
  {
    "MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim",
    ft = { "markdown" },
    dependencies = { "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter", "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons" },
    keys = {
      { "<leader>mr", ":RenderMarkdown toggle<CR>", desc = "Markdown render toggle" },
    },
    opts = {
      heading = {
        sign = false,
        position = "inline",
        icons = { "# ", "## ", "### ", "#### ", "##### ", "###### " },
        width = "block",
        left_pad = 2,
        right_pad = 4,
      },
      code = {
        sign = false,
        left_pad = 2,
        right_pad = 4,
        border = "thick",
      },
      bullet = { right_pad = 2 },
    },
  },

  -- Optional: bold / italic / link toggles via Alt-key chords in visual mode
  {
    "tadmccorkle/markdown.nvim",
    ft = "markdown",
    opts = {
      on_attach = function(bufnr)
        local toggle = function(key)
          return "<Esc>gv<Cmd>lua require'markdown.inline'"
            .. ".toggle_emphasis_visual'" .. key .. "'<CR>"
        end
        vim.keymap.set("x", "<M-i>", toggle("i"), { buffer = bufnr }) -- italic
        vim.keymap.set("x", "<M-b>", toggle("l"), { buffer = bufnr }) -- bold
        vim.keymap.set("x", "<M-k>", toggle("l"), { buffer = bufnr }) -- link
      end,
    },
  },
}
```

Toggle rendering on/off with `<leader>mr`. For the full version (with browser preview, wikilinks, custom highlights), see my live config at [markdown.lua](https://github.com/sspaeti/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/.config/nvim/lua/sspaeti/plugins/markdown.lua).



## Multiple From Addresses

Add `[[senders]]` blocks to config to define extra identities that share an existing account's SMTP credentials:

```toml
[[senders]]
name    = "Work alias"
from    = "info@example.com"
account = "Personal"   # must match the name = field of an [[accounts]] block
```

In compose and pre-send, press `ctrl+f` to cycle through all configured accounts followed by all senders. The displayed `From:` field updates live. Sent copies always go to the active account's Sent folder regardless of which From is selected.

## CC, BCC, Reply-all, and Forward

In the compose form, `ctrl+b` toggles the Cc and Bcc fields (hidden by default). Bcc recipients receive the email but are never written to message headers. From the reader, `r` replies to the sender and `R` replies to the sender plus all Cc recipients (your own address excluded, `Reply-To` respected).

All replies include proper `In-Reply-To` and `References` headers for email threading, ensuring they appear in conversation threads in Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail.

Press `f` to forward an email — works from both the reader and the inbox list (the body is fetched automatically). The editor opens with the original message quoted and `Fwd:` prepended to the subject. Fill in the `# [neomd: to: ]` field and add your own text above the quoted block.

## Emoji Reactions

Press `ctrl+e` from the inbox or reader view to react to an email with a single emoji — a fast, lightweight way to acknowledge receipt without writing a full reply.

**Available reactions:**
- 👍 Thumbs up
- ❤️ Love
- 😂 Laugh
- 🎉 Celebrate
- 🙏 Thanks
- 💯 Perfect
- 👀 Eyes
- ✅ Check


![emoji](/images/emoji-reactions.png)

**How it works:**

1. Press `ctrl+e` while viewing or selecting an email
2. Choose an emoji by pressing `1`-`8` (instant send) or navigate with `j`/`k` and press `enter`
3. Press `esc` to cancel

The reaction is sent immediately (no editor, no pre-send review) as a properly formatted email with:

**Plain text:**
```
👍

```

**HTML:**
The emoji is displayed at 48px with a styled footer containing your name and a link to neomd. The original message is quoted below in a styled blockquote.

**Threading:**
Reactions include proper `In-Reply-To` and `References` headers so they appear in the conversation thread (tested with Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail). The original email is marked with the `\Answered` flag.

**From address:**
The reaction is automatically sent from the address that received the original email (same logic as regular replies). A copy is saved to your Sent folder.

Emoji reactions are perfect for quick acknowledgments, celebrating good news, or thanking someone without the overhead of composing a full reply.

## Attachments

Attachments are tightly integrated with both the pre-send screen and neovim.

**From the pre-send screen** — press `a` to open yazi (auto-detected; override with `$NEOMD_FILE_PICKER`). Press `D` to remove the last attachment.

**From within neovim** — press `<leader>a` in any `neomd-*.md` buffer to open yazi in a floating terminal. Selected files are inserted at the cursor as visible `[attach] /path/to/file` lines.


{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Requires** [custom.lua](https://github.com/sspaeti/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/.config/nvim/lua/sspaeti/custom.lua) added to your neovim config, and [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) installed.
{{< /callout >}}

neomd strips `[attach]` lines before sending:
- **Image files** (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`) → embedded inline in the HTML body; recipients see the image at that position
- **Other files** → appended as a regular MIME attachment

```markdown
Here is a screenshot:
[attach] /home/you/screenshots/overview.png

And a PDF for reference:
[attach] /home/you/docs/report.pdf
```

![neomd](/images/attachments-example.webp)

### Re-opening the editor: `# [attach]` header form

When you bounce out of pre-send back into the editor (`e` to re-edit, `s` to spell-check, `i` to hand off to an AI tool), or continue a saved draft, attachments that were already tracked are re-injected at the **top** of the buffer — right under the other `# [neomd: ...]` headers — using a `#`-prefixed form:

```markdown
# [neomd: to: hello@sspaeti.com]
# [neomd: bcc: simon.spaeti@gmail.com]
# [neomd: from: Simon Späti <simu@sspaeti.com>]
# [neomd: subject: Re: Website Banner Sponsorship]
# [attach] /home/you/docs/services-overview.pdf
# [attach] /home/you/docs/pricing.pdf

Hi Luca,
…
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Why two forms?** The `#`-prefixed form (`# [attach] /path`) is what neomd injects on re-open so attachments group visually with the rest of the metadata headers — your treesitter/render-markdown setup styles them as bold H1 headings, so they stand out. The plain form (`[attach] /path`) is what the `<leader>a` yazi helper inserts at the cursor, so you can still drop an image *inline* next to a paragraph and have it render in-place. Both are recognized; mix freely. The editor buffer is the source of truth — remove a `[attach]` line on save and that attachment is dropped.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Saved drafts: paths are `/tmp/neomd/draft-<name>-<random>`.** When you continue a draft from the Drafts folder (`E`), neomd re-extracts the saved attachment MIME parts to `/tmp/neomd/` and uses those temp paths in the re-injected `# [attach]` lines. This keeps the drafts loop closed even after the original local files moved or were deleted. If you'd rather attach the *current* version of those files, replace the temp paths with the originals before saving.
{{< /callout >}}

## Pre-send Review

After saving and closing the editor, neomd shows a review screen before sending — add or remove attachments, save to Drafts, or re-open the editor without sending accidentally.

![neomd](/images/presend-navigation.png)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `enter` | send |
| `p` | preview in `$BROWSER` — renders through the same pipeline as sending, with inline images visible |
| `a` | attach file via yazi |
| `D` | remove last attachment |
| `d` | save to Drafts (IMAP APPEND with `\Draft` flag) |
| `e` | re-open editor |
| `s` | re-open editor with nvim spell-check on, cursor on first error |
| `i` | hand off to an external AI tool (see [AI Handoff](#ai-handoff) below) |
| `esc` | cancel |

Press `p` to see exactly what the recipient will see — the email is rendered through the same goldmark Markdown-to-HTML pipeline used for sending. Local image paths from `[attach]` lines are converted to `file://` URLs so the browser displays them inline.

## AI Handoff

Press `i` on the pre-send screen to hand the current draft off to an external AI CLI (`claude`, `codex`, `aichat`, `sgpt`, …). neomd will:

1. Show a one-line prompt for your instruction (e.g. `fix grammar`, `make it more formal`, `tighten this`).
2. Write the current draft to a temp markdown file with the standard `# [neomd: ...]` headers.
3. Spawn `<command> [args...] <file>` (with `{prompt}` and `{file}` placeholders substituted in `args`). The spawned process's working directory is set to the temp dir holding the draft, so e.g. claude's built-in Edit tool can reach the file with no `--add-dir`.
4. Re-read the file on exit and replace your draft body — the same parser as the regular editor flow, so headers the AI may have rewritten (To, Cc, Bcc, Subject) are picked up automatically.

This is how it looks
![neomd](/images/ai-integration.png)

**Prompt modes:**

- **Empty prompt + Enter** — interactive mode. `{prompt}` is replaced by `""`, so the default `args = ["edit {file}: {prompt}"]` becomes `claude "edit neomd-ai-XYZ.md: "` and you continue the conversation inside the AI tool.
- **Typed instruction + Enter** — non-interactive: `claude "edit neomd-ai-XYZ.md: fix grammar"`. The tool edits the file and exits.
- **Esc** — cancel and return to pre-send.

Quit the AI tool (`ctrl+c`, `q`, `/quit`, `ZZ`, …) to return to neomd's pre-send screen with the edits picked up.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Default args use the *interactive* form, not `claude -p`.** The `-p` (print) flag in Claude Code is non-interactive and bills against your **API credits** rather than your Claude Pro/Max subscription — it leaks money even when you're paying for a plan. Interactive mode runs under your subscription auth. Only switch to `args = ["-p", "edit {file}: {prompt}"]` if you have an API key with credits and explicitly want the scripted, no-review flow.
{{< /callout >}}

`nvim` is intentionally **not** a useful default here — the compose buffer is already open in nvim before pre-send, so spawning nvim on `i` would just re-edit. You can already use [avante.nvim](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim) or similar inside the composer for in-editor AI; the `i` handoff is for picking a *different* tool. Set `[ai].command = ""` to disable the binding entirely.

For configuration (`[ai].command`, `[ai].args`, placeholders), see [Configuration → AI handoff](configuration#ai-handoff-pre-send-i-key).

## Drafts

Press `d` in the pre-send screen to save to Drafts instead of sending. Navigate to Drafts with `gd`. To resume a saved draft, open it and press `E` — it re-opens in the editor with all fields pre-filled, and saving goes through the normal pre-send review.

**Note:** Drafts are stored as plain text only (not multipart/alternative) to preserve markdown formatting when reopening. This prevents formatting corruption like line break addition, pipe escaping, and italic style changes.

## HTML Signatures

neomd supports dual-format signatures for professional email layouts with logos, tables, and styled text.

Configure separate text and HTML signatures in `[ui.signature_block]`:

```toml
[ui.signature_block]
  text = """[html-signature]"""

  html = """<table style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://example.com/logo.png" width="80"></td>
    <td>
      <strong>Your Name</strong><br>
      Your Title, Company Name
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>"""
```

**How it works:**

- The **text signature** appears in the editor and in the `text/plain` MIME part
- The **HTML signature** is appended to the `text/html` MIME part only
- Recipients using HTML email clients see the styled HTML signature
- Recipients using plain text clients see the text signature

**The `[html-signature]` placeholder:**

Include `[html-signature]` in your text signature (as shown above) to control HTML signature inclusion on a per-email basis:

- The placeholder is **visible** in the editor and pre-send preview
- When you send, neomd strips the placeholder and appends the HTML signature to the HTML part
- **Delete the placeholder** in the editor to send without the HTML signature for that specific email

This gives you full control: professional HTML signatures by default, plain signatures when needed.

**Best practices:**

- Use inline styles only (no `<style>` blocks) for maximum email client compatibility
- Host images externally (`https://example.com/logo.png`) so they display for recipients
- Test your HTML signature by sending to yourself first
- The `--` separator is added automatically before the text signature

For full HTML signature configuration examples, see [Configuration Reference](configuration#html-signatures).

For reading emails — images, links, attachments, and navigation — see [Reading Emails](reading).

## Callouts (Admonition)

neomd supports GitHub/Obsidian-style [callouts](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/admonition-call-outs) through the [this extension (with my fork)](https://github.com/sspaeti/goldmark-obsidian-callout-for-neomd) for highlighted information boxes in your emails. Use the `> [!TYPE]` syntax to create styled alert boxes:

This is how it looks at the recievers end:
![neomd](/images/callouts.png)

```markdown
> [!note]
> This is a note callout with default styling

> [!tip] Pro Tip
> Use custom titles by adding text after the type

> [!warning] Important
> Callouts can have multiple paragraphs
>
> Just add blank blockquote lines between them

```

**Available callout types:**
- `[!note]` — Blue info box
- `[!tip]` — Green success/tip box
- `[!warning]` — Yellow warning box

**Features:**
- Custom titles — add text after the type: `> [!warning] Security Alert`
- Multiple paragraphs — use `> ` (blockquote with space) for blank lines
- Works in both syntaxes: `> [!note]` (with space) or `>[!note]` (without space)

**What recipients see:**

HTML email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail) display callouts as colored boxes with:
- Colored left border (4px solid)
- Colored background
- Bold title with icon
- Proper spacing and padding

>[!NOTE]
> Plain text email clients show callouts as regular blockquotes (graceful degradation).

**Example in composed email:**

```markdown
Hi team,

Here's the update on the project:

> [!tip] Good News
> We're ahead of schedule! The new feature shipped yesterday.

> [!warning] Action Required
> Please review the security audit by Friday.
>
> Contact @security if you have questions.

Thanks,
Simon
```


## Format that email is sent
neomd sends every email as `multipart/alternative`:

- **`text/plain`** — the raw Markdown you wrote (readable as-is in any client)
- **`text/html`** — rendered by [goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark) with a clean CSS wrapper

This means recipients using Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook, etc. see properly formatted links, bold, headers, inline code, and code blocks — while you write nothing but Markdown.

When attachments are present the MIME structure is upgraded automatically:
- **Images** → `multipart/related` with `Content-ID` — displayed inline in the email body
- **Other files** (PDF, zip, …) → `multipart/mixed` — shown as downloadable attachments


## Mailto Handler

neomd can be your system's default `mailto:` handler. When you click a `mailto:` link in a browser, neomd opens in a terminal with the compose form pre-filled.

**Setup on Linux:**

```bash
# Register neomd as the default mailto handler
xdg-mime default neomd-mailto.desktop x-scheme-handler/mailto
```

The `.desktop` file at `~/.local/share/applications/neomd-mailto.desktop`:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=neomd (mailto)
Comment=Compose email in neomd terminal email client
Exec=foot -e /path/to/neomd-mailto.sh %u
Icon=mail-send
Terminal=false
NoDisplay=true
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/mailto;
```

Replace `foot` with your terminal emulator (`alacritty`, `kitty`, `ghostty`, etc.). See the [wrapper script](#wrapper-script) section below for why a wrapper is needed.

**Usage:**

```bash
# From the CLI (flag or positional argument)
neomd --mailto "mailto:user@example.com?subject=Hello&body=Check%20this%20out"
neomd "mailto:user@example.com?subject=Hello"

# Test the xdg handler
xdg-open "mailto:user@example.com?subject=Test&body=Hello%20world"
```

Supported mailto fields: `to` (path), `cc`, `bcc`, `subject`, `body`. neomd opens the compose form with all fields pre-filled — proceed through the normal compose flow (To → Subject → editor → pre-send → send).


### Browser setup (Brave/Chrome)

Chromium-based browsers maintain their own protocol handler list that can override the system default. To use neomd for mailto links in Brave:

1. Go to `brave://settings/handlers` (or `chrome://settings/handlers` for Chrome)
2. Remove any existing mailto handler (e.g. `office.hostpoint.ch`, `mail.google.com`)
3. Next time you click a mailto link, Brave will show a dialog asking to open neomd

Check "Always allow" in the dialog to skip the prompt in the future.

### Wrapper script

Since neomd is a TUI app, it needs a login shell to access environment variables (e.g. IMAP passwords). The `.desktop` file uses a wrapper script:

`~/.local/bin/neomd-mailto.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
source ~/.zshrc 2>/dev/null
/home/sspaeti/.local/bin/neomd "$1" 2>/tmp/neomd-mailto.log
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "neomd failed. Log:"
    cat /tmp/neomd-mailto.log
    read -p "Press enter to close."
fi
```

Make it executable: `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/neomd-mailto.sh`

Then reference it in the `.desktop` file:

```ini
Exec=foot -e /home/sspaeti/.local/bin/neomd-mailto.sh %u
```

Replace `zsh`/`.zshrc` with `bash`/`.bashrc` if you use bash. Replace `foot` with your terminal emulator.
