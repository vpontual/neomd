neomd can fire desktop notifications via `notify-send` (or any compatible CLI) when **specific** senders deliver new mail. The list of "notify-worthy" senders is independent of the screener categories — being approved (`screened_in`) does not automatically mean you want to be paged about it.

Notifications fire from the **TUI only**. The headless daemon (`neomd --headless`) screens mail silently so notifications don't end up on a NAS where no one sees them.

## Quick start

1. Make sure `notify-send` is installed and a notification daemon is running (`mako`, `dunst`, `swaync`, …). On Hyprland with mako:

   ```sh
   notify-send "neomd" "test"
   ```

   should pop up a notification.

2. Add the senders (or domains) you care about to `~/.config/neomd/lists/notify.txt`, one per line:

   ```
   # exact addresses
   alice@example.com
   boss@work.com

   # whole domain (any address at the domain)
   @important.org
   ```

3. Enable notifications in `~/.config/neomd/config.toml`:

   ```toml
   [notifications]
   enabled  = true                # default: false
   command  = "notify-send"       # default
   icon     = "mail-message-new"  # default; passed as --icon
   expire_ms = 5000               # default
   folders  = ["Inbox"]           # only fire when the new mail lands here
   ```

4. Restart neomd. The first inbox load **records a baseline** silently — no notifications fire for the mail you already have. From then on, any new mail whose sender matches `notify.txt` and lands in one of `folders` triggers a notification.

## When notifications fire

A notification is fired when **all** of the following are true:

- `[notifications].enabled = true`
- The email's UID is greater than the per-folder baseline neomd has recorded (`~/.cache/neomd/notify_state.json`)
- The sender (after lower-casing) matches an exact entry or `@domain` entry in `notify.txt`
- After auto-screening, the email's destination folder is in `[notifications].folders`

If any check fails the email is processed normally but no notification fires.

## Domain entries

Same syntax as the screener lists — a line starting with `@` matches every address at that domain:

```
# notify.txt
@ssp.sh
ceo@bigcorp.com
```

Exact entries match before `@domain` entries, but for `notify.txt` the priority doesn't matter (both produce the same notification). Use whichever is more convenient.

## Configuration reference

| Field        | Default            | Description                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`    | `false`            | Master switch; opt-in.                                                       |
| `command`    | `"notify-send"`    | Notification binary. See [Custom command](#custom-command) below.            |
| `icon`       | `"mail-message-new"` | Passed as `-i`/`--icon`.                                                   |
| `expire_ms`  | `5000`             | Passed as `-t`. Milliseconds the notification stays on screen.               |
| `folders`    | `["Inbox"]`        | Folder labels (case-insensitive) that count for notifications.               |

### Notification content

Notifications are sent with these arguments:

```
notify-send -i <icon> -t <expire_ms> -a neomd "neomd: <From>" "<Subject>"
```

Subjects longer than 200 characters are truncated with `…`.

### Custom command

`command` is passed to `os/exec` directly with the same positional arguments as `notify-send`. If you want to use a non-`notify-send`-compatible notifier (e.g. `hyprctl notify`, which takes a totally different argument layout), wrap it in a small shell script:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ~/.local/bin/neomd-hyprctl-notify
# Usage: <-i icon> <-t expire_ms> <-a app> <title> <body>
shift 6
hyprctl notify 0 5000 "rgb(00ff00)" "$1: $2"
```

Then in `config.toml`:

```toml
[notifications]
command = "/home/you/.local/bin/neomd-hyprctl-notify"
```

## State file

The per-folder baseline UID is stored at `~/.cache/neomd/notify_state.json` (`~/.cache/neomd-demo/...` for the demo config). Deleting this file forces a re-baseline on next launch (no notifications fire until the *next* new email arrives).

## Why this is opt-in

The default is `enabled = false` so neomd never surprises a fresh user with desktop popups. Once turned on, the **first** fetch is also silent — neomd records the highest UID it sees and only notifies for messages newer than that. This way you don't get flooded with notifications for your entire current Inbox the first time the feature is enabled.
