title: Reading Emails
weight: 4
---

Emails are rendered as styled Markdown in the terminal using [glamour](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour). The reader supports vim-style navigation.

## Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | scroll line by line |
| `space` / `d` | page down / up |
| `gg` | jump to top of email |
| `G` | jump to bottom of email |
| `h` / `q` / `esc` | back to inbox |

## Opening Emails Externally

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `e` | open in `$EDITOR` (read-only) — search, copy, vim motions |
| `o` | open in w3m (terminal browser, clickable links) |
| `O` | open in `$BROWSER` (GUI browser, images rendered) |
| `ctrl+o` | open newsletter web version in `$BROWSER` (from `List-Post` header) |

## Images

Remote images appear as `[Image: alt]` placeholders, keeping the reading experience clean and fast. To see images, press `O` to open in your browser.

**Inline / attached images** (e.g. screenshots pasted into an email) are listed in the reader header: `Attach:  [1] screenshot.png  [2] report.pdf`. Press `1`–`9` to download to `~/Downloads/` and open with `xdg-open`. Inline images also show `[Image: filename.png]` placeholders at their position in the body text.

When you press `O` to open in the browser, inline images are extracted from the email and saved to temp files. The HTML `cid:` references are rewritten to `file://` paths so the browser renders them — including images sent by other people (not just your own).

## Spy Pixel Blocking

neomd automatically detects and blocks tracking pixels, similar to [HEY's spy pixel blocker](https://www.hey.com/features/spy-pixel-blocker/). Since the TUI renders emails as styled Markdown via glamour, remote images are never fetched — senders cannot tell if you read their email.

**Two-layer detection** (same approach as HEY):
1. **Curated denylist** — 150+ tracking services with URL pattern matching, sourced from [Simplify](https://github.com/leggett/simplify-trackers) (BSD-3-Clause), [LeaveMeAlone](https://github.com/leavemealone-app/email-trackers) (CC-BY 3.0), and [DHH's original HEY list](https://gist.github.com/dhh/360f4dc7ddbce786f8e82b97cdad9d20) (MIT). Covers Mailchimp, HubSpot, SendGrid, ConvertKit, Substack, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, and many more. When matched, the service name is shown (e.g. "Mailchimp").
2. **Generic 1×1 pixel heuristic** — catches custom/branded tracking domains not on the list by detecting `<img>` tags with empty `alt` AND tiny dimensions (both width/height 0–1) or CSS hiding (`display:none`). Layout spacers (e.g. 1×50) are not flagged.

When tracking pixels are detected, neomd shows:
- `°` indicator in the inbox list (orange, next to the attachment `@` column)
- `° N spy pixel(s) blocked (ServiceName)` in the reader header with tracker attribution

**Scanning:** Spy pixels are detected when you read an email. To scan all emails in the current folder at once, press `<space>S` or run `:scan-spy-pixels` (alias `:ssp`). The scan runs in the background, skips already-scanned emails, and uses IMAP PEEK (won't mark emails as read). Results are cached in `~/.cache/neomd/spy_pixels` and persist across restarts.

When you press `O` to open in the browser, remote images load normally — you're explicitly choosing to see the full email. Tracking pixel blocking is a TUI-level protection.

### This is how it looks:

And within an email open:

## Links

Links in emails are automatically numbered inline where they appear in the body. A link like `Check out our blog` renders as `Check out our blog [1]` in the terminal.

Press `space` then a digit (`1`–`9`, `0` for 10th) to open the link in `$BROWSER`.

- Up to 10 links per email, deduplicated by URL
- Numbers appear inline so you can see them while reading without scrolling
- If an email has no links, `space` works as page-down as usual

## Attachments

Attachments are listed in the reader header:

```
Attach:  [1] report.pdf  [2] photo.png
```

Press `1`–`9` to download attachment N to `~/Downloads/` and open it with `xdg-open`. Filenames are deduplicated automatically if a file already exists.

## Download Raw Email Source

Press `space` then `d` in the reader to download the full raw email source (`.eml` file) to `~/Downloads/`. The file is named `neomd-YYYYMMDD-<subject>.eml` using the email's date and sanitized subject line.

This is useful for archiving emails, debugging headers, or importing into other email clients. The status bar shows a green confirmation when the download completes.

## Threaded Inbox

Related emails are automatically grouped together in the inbox list. Threads are detected using a hybrid approach:

1. **Message-ID / In-Reply-To headers** — proper RFC 2822 threading chain
2. **Subject + participant fallback** — emails with the same normalized subject (stripped of `Re:`, `Fwd:`, etc.) and overlapping participants (From/To) are grouped together

Threads display with a Twitter-style vertical connector line:

```

```

- `·` reply indicator — you've replied to this email (IMAP `\Answered` flag, works across clients)
- `·╰ ` reply indicator within a thread
- `│` connects thread members (newest on top)
- `╰` marks the root/oldest email at the bottom of each thread
- `°` spy pixel indicator — tracking pixels were detected and blocked (shown after first read)
- Non-threaded emails show no connector (clean, no visual noise)
- Threads are sorted by their most recent email, so active conversations float to the top

## Replying, Forwarding, and Drafts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `r` | reply to sender |
| `ctrl+r` | reply-all (sender + all CC recipients) |
| `f` | forward email |
| `T` | show full conversation thread across folders |
| `E` | continue draft (only in Drafts folder) — re-opens as editable compose |

## Conversation View

Press `T` from the inbox list or while reading an email to see the **full conversation across folders**. neomd searches Inbox, Sent, Archive, Waiting, and other configured folders for related emails — matching by normalized subject and participant overlap.

Results display in a temporary "Thread" tab:
- Each email shows `[Folder]` prefix (e.g. `[Sent]`, `[Inbox]`, `[Archive]`)
- Threading connectors (`│`/`╰`) show the conversation structure
- Press Enter to read any email, Esc to return to previous view

Also available as `:thread` (alias `:t`) from the command line.

## Mark as Read Behavior

Neomd marks emails as read **after you've spent time viewing them**, not immediately when opened. This prevents accidental marking when quickly peeking at emails.

**How it works:**

- When you open an email (press `enter` or `l`), neomd fetches the full body from IMAP
- Once the body loads, a **timer starts** (default: 7 seconds)
- If you stay in the reader for the full duration, the email is marked as `\Seen` on the server
- If you exit early (press `h`, `q`, `esc`, or `T`), the email **stays unread**

**Configuration:**

```toml
[ui]
mark_as_read_after_secs = 7   # wait 7 seconds (default)
# mark_as_read_after_secs = 0   # immediate marking (no timer)
# mark_as_read_after_secs = 10  # 10 seconds
```

Set to `0` for immediate marking (as soon as the body finishes loading). Set to any value in seconds to customize the delay.

**UI behavior:**

- The local inbox list updates immediately when an email is marked as read — no need to manually refresh
- The unread indicator (`N`) disappears as soon as marking completes
- Manual toggle with `n` still works to mark/unmark emails at any time

## Reply Indicator

Emails you've replied to show a `·` dot in the inbox list. This uses the standard IMAP `\Answered` flag, so it works across clients — if you reply from webmail, neomd shows it too.
