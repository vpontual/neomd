On first run, neomd creates `~/.config/neomd/config.toml` with placeholders.

## Full example

```toml
[[accounts]]
name     = "Personal"
imap     = "imap.example.com:993"   # :993 = TLS, :143 = STARTTLS
smtp     = "smtp.example.com:587"   # :587 = STARTTLS, :465 = TLS
user     = "me@example.com"
password = "app-password"
from     = "Me <me@example.com>"
starttls = false                    # optional: force STARTTLS (see TLS/STARTTLS section below)
tls_cert_file = ""                  # optional PEM cert/CA for self-signed local bridges
imap_disabled = false               # set true for send-only accounts (no IMAP connection)

# OAuth2 authenticated accounts are supported, it just need the relevant fields. Note that the password field is not required.

# tab_order controls the left-to-right tab sequence; omit to use the built-in default order. e.g.:
# tab_order = ["inbox", "to_screen", "feed", "papertrail", "waiting", "someday", "scheduled", "sent", "archive", "screened_out", "drafts", "trash"]
# Gmail uses different folder names — see docs/content/gmail.md for the correct mapping.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Gmail** uses different IMAP folder names (`[Gmail]/Sent Mail`, `[Gmail]/Trash`, etc.). See [Gmail Configuration](configurations/gmail) for the correct mapping.
{{< /callout >}}

Use an app-specific password (Gmail, Fastmail, Hostpoint, etc.) rather than your main account password.

`inbox_count` is a fetch cap for normal folder loads and startup auto-screening. If you want to re-screen the entire Inbox on the IMAP server, use `:screen-all` from inside neomd; that scans every Inbox email, not just the loaded subset, and can take a while on large mailboxes.

## Environment Variables

The `password` and `user` fields support environment variable expansion. If the entire value is a single env var reference, neomd resolves it at startup:

```toml
password = "$IMAP_PASS"        # $VAR form
password = "${IMAP_PASS}"      # ${VAR} form
```

Values containing other text or multiple `$` signs are left as-is, so passwords that happen to contain `$` are never mangled.

Credentials are stored only in `~/.config/neomd/config.toml` (mode 0600) and never written elsewhere; all IMAP connections use TLS (port 993) or STARTTLS (port 143).

## TLS and STARTTLS Configuration

Neomd automatically determines the correct encryption method based on the port and the optional `starttls` config field:

**IMAP ports:**
- `993` → Implicit TLS (standard IMAPS)
- `143` → STARTTLS upgrade (standard IMAP)
- Non-standard ports (e.g., `1143` for Proton Mail Bridge) → TLS by default
- Set `starttls = true` to force STARTTLS on any port

**SMTP ports:**
- `465` → Implicit TLS (SMTPS)
- `587` → STARTTLS upgrade (modern submission standard)
- Non-standard ports (e.g., `1025` for Proton Mail Bridge) → TLS by default
- Set `starttls = true` to force STARTTLS on any port

**Examples:**

Standard provider (Gmail, Hostpoint, etc.):
```toml
[[accounts]]
imap = "imap.gmail.com:993"
smtp = "smtp.gmail.com:587"
starttls = false  # optional, default behavior works
tls_cert_file = ""
```

Proton Mail Bridge (local bridge on non-standard ports):
```toml
[[accounts]]
imap = "127.0.0.1:1143"  # Uses TLS automatically
smtp = "127.0.0.1:1025"  # Uses TLS; set starttls=true if bridge uses STARTTLS
starttls = false
tls_cert_file = "~/ProtonBridge/cert.pem"  # optional: exported Bridge cert
```

Custom server with STARTTLS on non-standard port:
```toml
[[accounts]]
imap = "mail.custom.com:2143"
smtp = "mail.custom.com:2587"
starttls = true  # Forces STARTTLS instead of TLS
```

See [Proton Bridge Setup](configurations/proton-bridge) for complete Proton Mail Bridge setup instructions.

For localhost/self-signed bridges such as Proton Mail Bridge, neomd first tries
normal certificate verification. If that fails with an unknown-authority error
on a loopback host (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`), neomd retries once with a
localhost-only fallback so existing Bridge setups keep working. If you want
strict verification, export the Bridge certificate and set `tls_cert_file`.

## Sent and Drafts Storage

When multiple accounts or `[[senders]]` aliases are configured, SMTP delivery
always uses the selected sending identity's account.

By default, IMAP storage for Sent and Drafts uses the first configured account,
so one primary mailbox owns your sent/draft archive:

```toml
store_sent_drafts_in_sending_account = false
```

If you want Sent and Drafts to follow the selected sending account instead, set:

```toml
store_sent_drafts_in_sending_account = true
```

## Send-Only Accounts (`imap_disabled`)

Set `imap_disabled = true` on an account to use it only for sending. Neomd will skip IMAP connection, folder fetching, and screening for that account. The account remains available as a From address via `ctrl+f` in compose/pre-send.

```toml
[[accounts]]
name          = "Gmail"
imap          = "imap.gmail.com:993"
smtp          = "smtp.gmail.com:587"
user          = "me@gmail.com"
password      = "$GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD"
from          = "Me <me@gmail.com>"
imap_disabled = true
```

`ctrl+a` account cycling skips IMAP-disabled accounts. Useful for adding a provider purely for sending without fetching its emails.

## Sending and Discarding

To abort a compose without sending, close neovim with `ZQ` or `:q!` (discard). To send, save normally with `ZZ` or `:wq`.

## Signature

The `signature` field in `[ui]` is appended automatically when opening a new compose buffer (`c`). It is **not** added for replies. The separator `--` is inserted for you — just write the signature body in Markdown.

Use TOML triple-quoted strings (`"""`) to preserve line breaks. The signature appears at the end of the buffer — you can edit or delete it before saving.

### HTML Signatures

For professional HTML signatures (with logos, tables, styled text), use the `[ui.signature_block]` config with separate `text` and `html` fields:

```toml
[ui.signature_block]
  text = """[html-signature]"""

  html = """<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-top: 20px;">
  <tr>
    <td style="padding-right: 20px; vertical-align: top;">
      <img src="https://example.com/logo.png" alt="Company Name" width="80" style="display: block; border: 0;">
    </td>
    <td style="border-left: 2px solid #e0e0e0; padding-left: 20px;">
      <div style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <strong style="font-size: 16px; color: #1a1a1a;">Your Name</strong><br>
        <span style="color: #666; font-size: 13px;">Your Title, Company Name</span>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 6px; font-size: 13px; color: #888;">
        <span>Connect:</span>
        <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/..." style="text-decoration: none; margin: 0 4px;">LinkedIn</a>
      </div>
      <div style="font-size: 11px; color: #999; font-style: italic;">
        sent from <a href="https://neomd.ssp.sh" style="text-decoration: none;">neomd</a>
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>"""
```

**How it works:**

- **Text signature** — appears in the editor buffer and in the `text/plain` MIME part
- **HTML signature** — appends to the `text/html` MIME part only (recipients using HTML email clients see this)
- **`[html-signature]` placeholder** — include this in your text signature to enable HTML signature for a specific email; visible in the editor and pre-send preview, but stripped before sending
- **Per-email control** — delete the `[html-signature]` line in the editor to send without the HTML signature for that email


#### This is how it looks

The sent e-mail with above HTML signature looks like this:
![HTML signature example](/images/html-signature.png)

In the email as text:
```markdown
Hello there

how are you
here's my new HTML signature below.
BR Simon

--
[html-signature]
```


**Notes:**

- Use inline styles only (no `<style>` blocks or external CSS) for maximum email client compatibility
- Host logo images externally (e.g., `https://example.com/logo.png`) so they display for recipients
- The `text` field is backward compatible: if empty, neomd falls back to the legacy `signature` field
- The `--` separator is added automatically before the text signature

## OAuth2 Authentication

Neomd supports OpenAuth2 authenticated accounts, you just need to add `oauth2_client_id`, `oauth2_client_secret`, `oauth2_scopes` and `oauth2_issuer_url`.

Note that when using oauth2 authentication, the password field is not required in the account configuration.

### Issuer URL

By default, if an issuer URL is provided, i.e.: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0` for Office265 accounts, neomd will search for the OpenID Connect discovery URL: `/.well-known/openid-configuration` resolving then the `oauth2_token_url` and `oauth2_auth_url`. These parameters can be provided manually as well.

### Scopes

The scopes required depends on the provider and is better confirmed by your email provider. As an example, for Office365 acounts, the following scopes are required for IMAP: `"https://outlook.office365.com/IMAP.AccessAsUser.All", "offline_access"`.

### Reference documentation for GMAIL and Office365
