Proton Mail Bridge allows you to use neomd with ProtonMail accounts by running a local IMAP/SMTP bridge.

## Installation

1. Install Proton Mail Bridge: https://proton.me/mail/bridge
2. Launch the bridge and configure your ProtonMail account
3. Note the IMAP and SMTP connection details (typically `127.0.0.1:1143` and `127.0.0.1:1025`)

## neomd Configuration

Add the following to your `~/.config/neomd/config.toml` - notice that you cannot use folder named `Scheduled` as  it's internally used for scheduled emails:

```toml
[[accounts]]
  name = "ProtonMail"
  imap = "127.0.0.1:1143"
  smtp = "127.0.0.1:1025"
  user = "your-proton-email@proton.me"
  password = "bridge-password-here"  # Get this from Proton Bridge settings
  from = "Your Name <your-proton-email@proton.me>"
  starttls = false  # Proton Bridge uses TLS on non-standard ports
  tls_cert_file = "~/ProtonBridge/cert.pem"  # optional: exported Bridge certificate


[folders]
  inbox = "INBOX"
  sent = "Sent"
  trash = "Trash"
  drafts = "Drafts"
  to_screen = "Folders/ToScreen"
  feed = "Folders/Feed"
  papertrail = "Folders/PaperTrail"
  screened_out = "Folders/ScreenedOut"
  archive = "Archive"
  waiting = "Folders/Waiting"
  scheduled = "Folders/sched"
  someday = "Folders/Someday"
  spam = "Spam"
  work = ""
  tab_order = ["inbox", "to_screen", "feed", "papertrail", "waiting", "scheduled", "someday", "archive", "sent", "screened_out", "trash"]

```

## Key Configuration Details

- **IMAP Port**: Proton Bridge defaults to `1143` with TLS
- **SMTP Port**: Proton Bridge defaults to `1025` with STARTTLS
  - If you need STARTTLS for SMTP, set `starttls = true`
- **Password**: Use the bridge-generated password (not your ProtonMail password)
- **TLS/STARTTLS**: neomd automatically detects the correct security mode based on:
  - Standard ports (993→TLS, 143→STARTTLS for IMAP; 465→TLS, 587→STARTTLS for SMTP)
  - Non-standard ports default to TLS unless `starttls = true` is set
  - Explicit `starttls = true` always forces STARTTLS
- **Certificate**: Proton Bridge uses a self-signed certificate because the IMAP/SMTP server only runs on your own computer. neomd now handles this in two ways:
  - Best: export the Bridge certificate and set `tls_cert_file`
  - Fallback: for `127.0.0.1` / `localhost`, neomd retries once if verification fails with an unknown-authority error

## Troubleshooting

### "refusing unencrypted connection to 127.0.0.1:1143"

This error occurred in older versions of neomd that didn't respect the `starttls` config or handle non-standard ports correctly. **This is now fixed** (v0.4.15+).

If you still see this error:
1. Ensure you're running the latest version: `neomd --version`
2. Check your config has the correct IMAP/SMTP addresses
3. Verify Proton Bridge is running: `ps aux | grep bridge`

### "tls: failed to verify certificate"

This usually means Proton Bridge presented its local self-signed certificate and
your client did not trust it yet.

Recommended fix:
1. In Proton Mail Bridge, export the TLS certificates
2. Point `tls_cert_file` at the exported `cert.pem`
3. Keep `starttls = false` for IMAP on `1143` unless your Bridge shows otherwise

Without `tls_cert_file`, neomd now retries once for loopback hosts only, which
keeps common Proton Bridge setups working without affecting normal remote IMAP servers.

### Connection Refused

- Make sure Proton Mail Bridge is running
- Verify the bridge ports in its settings (they may differ from the defaults)
- Check firewall settings allow localhost connections

## Custom Ports

If your Proton Bridge uses different ports, adjust the config accordingly:

```toml
imap = "127.0.0.1:YOUR_IMAP_PORT"
smtp = "127.0.0.1:YOUR_SMTP_PORT"
```

For non-standard ports, neomd defaults to TLS. If your bridge uses STARTTLS on a custom port, add:

```toml
starttls = true
```
